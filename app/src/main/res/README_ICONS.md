# App Icon Generation Instructions

To properly generate all required app icons:

1. Open this project in Android Studio
2. Right-click on the `res` folder
3. Select "New > Image Asset"
4. In the Asset Studio dialog:
   - Icon Type: Launcher Icons (Adaptive & Legacy)
   - Name: ic_launcher
   - Foreground Layer:
     - Source: Select the Vector Asset option
     - Choose a relevant icon or import your custom vector
     - Color: #3F51B5 (or your preferred brand color)
   - Background Layer:
     - Source: Color
     - Color: #FFFFFF (or your preferred background color)
   - Legacy: Generate legacy launcher icons
   - Click Next and then Finish

This will generate all the necessary icon files for various densities and formats.

## Note on Current Placeholder Icons

The current implementation includes:

- Vector drawables for adaptive icons
- Placeholder binary files for standard density icons

To ensure the app shows proper icons on all devices, complete the icon generation process using Android Studio as described above.
