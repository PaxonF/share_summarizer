You should use raw markdown formatting to make the summary more readable. Use headers, italics, bold, or other markdown formatting to make the summarization clear, and only if appropriate. Do not include any other text in your response. Use bullet points or lists sparingly. Main headers and key ideas should not be bullet points or lists."
